### Data Synchronization and Backup Management in Networking

Data backup is the process of creating a copy of data and storing it in cloud-based software for recovery in case the original data gets lost. The data synchronization process establishes consistency between two or more devices and updates changes between them. Data backup and synchronization become used as interchangeable solutions for protecting data. Mostly, we get advised to keep our files backed up so that if they are lost, one can retrieve them.
### Synchronization Process
As we all know, data synchronization is the process of establishing consistency between two or more devices and updating changes between them.
Types of synchronization
server-client, which is one too many.
Node to node/many to many here, all systems can push data.
Sync 2-way, which is between the mobile node and a PC.
The server-altered sync: here, the server tells the client to request data that the client pulls, e.g., email.
Client-initiated: The client sends data, e.g., device configuration changes.
In data synchronization, Sync-ML is a framework that provides protocols, tools, and a markup language for synchronization. WAP 2.0 makes use of it.

### Patterns of Data Synchronization
Synchronization pattern characteristics
-What kinds of data entities will be involved in the synchronization?
-What kind of local storage entities are these on both sides? Are they similar or duplicate entities, or do they have different types of structures that must be met?
- Metadata is needed to keep track of other information about the synchronization.
- Some local storage entities get modified to include metadata attributes to track how frequently that entity has changed or what type of change has occurred.
- Updating data depends on the network status, whether online or offline.
- What steps will we need to synchronize the data to the server? It depends on what pattern gets used.

### Offline synchronization patterns
#### Read-Only Data

Here, the server can update data in the database. The device does not change data in the local storage area, and if it does, changes are not sent to the server.
Synchronization steps:

- Synchronization is accomplished by the client calling the server to get data. 
- The server returns all the data, and the client deletes the current local storage and creates a new local storage entity. 
- Its advantage is that it sends data every time, although it's insufficient for large data sets. 

#### Read-Only Data Optimization

Here, the device changes the data, but now it's optimized, giving the data that has changed.
Only the server will be able to update the database. The device won't change any of the data, and if it does, changes are not sent to the server. 

Synchronization steps:
- it is accomplished by the client calling the server with the last sync time and the server checking for all the context that has been changed since the last sync date. 
- It looks for contacts that have been deleted and sets its findings to a list and then sends it to the client as an output. 
- The client then updates the list to the current local storage entities and then updates the last sync time. 
- This pattern is more efficient since it only sends changed data.

#### Read-Write Data
In read-write scenarios, whenever the last update occurs, it is going to push it to the database and that will be the correct data.

Synchronization steps:

- The client on the device side will retrieve all the entities that have changed, i.e., added, updated, and deleted entities. 
- The client calls the server with a list of changes, and the server updates the data and then returns the updated list of data. 
- The client then deletes the current local storage entities. All data gets returned with each synchronization. 
- This pattern is simple but not sufficient for larger datasets.

#### Read-Write with Conflict Detection
This pattern helps to solve the problem of detecting conflicts that may have occurred when multiple people update the same piece of data. When one of the servers goes ahead and updates something that has already changed, the pattern detects the conflict and resolves it.

Synchronization steps:

- The client checks if there are any unresolved conflicts, and if there are any, it aborts the synchronization process. 
- It then retrieves changed entities and calls the server with a list of changes using the last sync time. 
- The server checks data for conflicting changes, creates a list of conflicts, and then updates the data.
- The server returns an updated list of data and the list of conflicts checked by the client. 
- The client then deletes current local storage and creates new local storage entities, resolving pending conflicts.

### Maintaining data backup
1. Use of Remote Storage
Backing up files on removable media like CDs, DVDs, newer Blu-Ray disks, or USB flash drives is simple. This is feasible in smaller environments, but for larger data volumes, you'll need to back up multiple disks, complicating recovery. Also, make sure your backups are in a separate location; otherwise, they may get lost in the event of a disaster. Tape backups are part of this category.
2. Use of external hard drives
You can set up a network with a large-capacity external hard drive and utilize archive software to preserve changes to local files of that drive. However, when your data quantities expand, one external drive will no longer suffice, and your RPO will skyrocket. Using an external drive means deploying it on the local network, which is dangerous.
3. Use of hardware appliances
Many suppliers offer entire backup appliances, commonly installed in 19" rack-mounted devices. Backup appliances come with plenty of storage and backup software pre-installed. You set up backup agents on the systems you want to back up, create a backup schedule and policy, and the data begins to flow to the backup device. As with previous solutions, try to isolate the backup device from the local network and, if possible, place it in a remote location.
4. Use of backup software's
Software-based backup solutions are difficult to set up and maintain than hardware backup appliances, but they provide more flexibility. They let you specify the systems and data you want to back up, assign backups to the storage device of your choosing, and control the backup process automatically.
5. Utilization of cloud backup services
Many manufacturers and cloud providers provide backup as a Service (BaaS) solutions, which allow you to back up local data to a public or private cloud and then restore data from the cloud in the event of a disaster. BaaS systems are simple to use, and they offer the added benefit of storing data in a secure location. If you use a public cloud, you must follow all applicable laws and regulations, and keep in mind that cloud storage costs will be significantly higher over time than on-premises storage.
 
 
### Cloud Backup vs. Cloud Synchronization

Thanks to cloud sync, client devices, and cloud storage both have the same set of files and directories. One-way sync automatically uploads files to the cloud as they are edited, and users can manually download them. 

A cloud is an intermediate storage with two-way sync. When modified files are submitted, they get downloaded by all clients. Two-way sync is used by almost all public services, such as Google Drive and Dropbox. To understand cloud sync, you can think of it in this way: if you access a file on your computer from home via a sync service in the morning, make changes, and then go to work or a friend's house, you can view the same file with all of the modifications made on the other machine. You can even share the file with another person, who can edit it from their computer, and the changes will appear on yours. In any case, the file is always in sync, regardless of where you view it.

Cloud backup should be used in conjunction with cloud storage, which is the act of storing data on the cloud, as it provides a safe and secure offshore. Cloud storage gives users access to folders and can share as much data as they require. It provides security as the information is saved repeatedly, making it accessible in practically any situation. Backing up to a tape, a CD, or an external hard drive was the most common method before the cloud became a widely available and popular destination. 

Because it eliminated the need for manual backups by automating the process, the cloud quickly became the most popular off-site storage medium as it became more widely available and affordable. Backups are easier and more reliable when they are automated. Data loss gets avoided by using cloud backup. Even with cloud storage, there is a chance that your data will be lost due to end-user error and ransomware attacks, among other things. 

A cloud backup solution copies a safe copy of your data to a completely separate storage environment and keeps it safe for an indefinite amount of time. This enables you to effectively restore your data in the event of a disaster. Cloud backup is a service that automates and simplifies the transfer of data to cloud storage based on a set of specified settings, while cloud synchronization enables users to share files and synchronize data across many devices.

### Common backup methods

- Full backup-here, a copy of all data is stored and runs according to a predefined schedule.
- Incremental back up- a copy of new or changed files since the last backup is stored.
- Differential backups- a copy of new and changed files since the last full backup was run is stored.
- Virtual full backup- a database manages data backups by making a full replica of the source data once as long as the target location does not change or is removed. The restoration process is similar to a full backup.

### Why should you back up files?

- Users are assured their information is safe since it prevents data loss.
- With cloud-managed backup services, you can check - in on backup status anytime and anywhere.
By preventing repetitions, data backup saves time.
- Data loss may happen at any point in time.
- It provides you with a sense of data security. As a result, you won't worry about the different circumstances that frequently result in data loss.

### Tools for Data Synchronization
Data synchronization tools guarantee that modifications to your data are updated according to the criteria established by your security requirements.
Examples of data synchronization tools
- SpiderOak Secure Sync.
- 2BrightSparks SyncBackPro
- Grig Software Synchronize It!
- ZumoDrive.
- Wuala.

### Conclusion
Finally, data synchronization ensures data consistency across numerous databases, while backup management aids in database recovery in the event of a breakdown. Synchronization is the process of making data or information from multiple locations identical, whereas backup is the process of creating duplicate copies of the same material. Mostly we are advised to keep our files backed up in case they are lost one can recover them.
